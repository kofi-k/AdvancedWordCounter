This  Java program  is capable of counting the unique words in a text file and displaying them (the word and the frequency of the word) in a GUI application.

Files used to test the code can be found in the files folder. ctrl + c ctrl + v the folder to your local disk C:\\ directory 


This code is clumsy for sure but you know the drill, It WORKS!!!
But together we can make it work even better and cleaner.
