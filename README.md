# Advanced Word Counter

This Java program is capable of counting the unique words in a text file and displaying them (the word and the frequency of the word) in a GUI application.

Files used to test the code can be found in the [files](files/) folder. 
All you really got to do is ***ctrl + c*** the folder and then ***ctrl + v*** it into your local disk C:\\ directory 

This code is clumsy for sure but you know the drill, **It WORKS!!!** for sure.
But together we can make it work even better and cleaner.

..now stop reading me and FORK it.
